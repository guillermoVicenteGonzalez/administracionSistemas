# administracionSistemas

## Project description
A college project for a sysadmin subject.
It is a small portal that lets user register themselves and access to a variety of services such as file storage, local mail, and a wp page
The system was hosted using debian and user interaction was achieved through apache and cgi files.

An important portion of the project was configuring the system (config files, programs, user administration, security etc) that coud not be included.

As with most university projects it was my first time tinkering with most of the tech used, so the result is sloppy.
